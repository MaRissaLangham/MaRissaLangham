**`Digital Craftsman (Student/Developer/Creator/BusinessOwner)`**

I am a proactive and driven student currently enrolled at Austin Community College, where I am simultaneously pursuing three degrees: a Bachelor of Applied Science in Software Development, an Associate of Science in Mathematics, and an Associate of Science in Physics. In addition to my academic pursuits, I hold the esteemed position of President and Founder of Byte Baes BÎ”Î£, an organization dedicated to empowering women in the field of technology.
    My academic journey reflects my unwavering commitment to excellence and a thirst for knowledge. I am relentlessly seeking opportunities in a dynamic and fast-paced environment that not only challenges me but also provides ample room for growth and advancement. As a collaborative and team-oriented individual, I firmly believe in the adage that hard work prevails when talent falls short. My passion for acquiring new skills is boundless, and I am particularly drawn to high-demand work settings where innovation and dedication thrive. I eagerly anticipate the prospect of applying my extensive knowledge and honed skills in a professional context, contributing to the ethos of continuous improvement. My aspiration is to make a significant impact in the workplace, and I am ready to seize the opportunity to do so.
