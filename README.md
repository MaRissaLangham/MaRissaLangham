**`Digital Craftsman (Student/Developer/Weaver)`**

:brain: Professional overthinker :japanese_ogre: Part-time gremlin :art: Full-time creator of Chaos. 
:speaking_head: Fluent in sarcasm, :chocolate_bar: snack-fueled, ☕️ 98% caffeine. 
 :sparkles: Unverified chaos entity. :sparkles: Might bite. :smiling_imp:

I’m a student at heart. I follow my Curiosity wherever it goes! My life is a rotating mixtape of studying, building, and creating. I’ve bounced across creative writing, brain science, physics, architecture, and plenty more. My interests don’t sit still, and neither do I. ✨ At home, I’m very much in my cozy era. I'm a wife + farm mom. I'm big on calm spaces, good practices, and little joys that make life feel grounded. I like things honest, balanced, and real… with a sense of humor because the universe is unserious.

I build projects in Python, Java, C++, & more. Usually tools that automate annoying tasks, turn ideas into something interactive, or help me learn faster. I like my code clean, my curiosity loud, and my projects practical with a dash of chaos.

Current mission: keep learning, keep building, and keep leveling up one commit at a time. 🚀
